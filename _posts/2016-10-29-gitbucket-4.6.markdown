Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 4.6](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.6)!

## Add disable option for forking

New option to disable repository forking has been available.

## Add History button to wiki page

History button has been added to wiki pages. In 4.5 or before, History button was available in only wiki page editing form.

## Git repository URL redirection

To improve external tools (like Jenkins) integration, GitHub like repository URL has been available.

For example,

```
http://localhost:8080/user1/gitbucket.git
```

a URL above is redirected to below:

```
http://localhost:8080/git/user1/gitbucket.git
```

## Get-Content API improvement

Get-Content API now supports files. It supported only directory in previous versions.

- API call:

  ```
  $ curl http://localhost:8080/api/v3/repos/user1/gitbucket/contents/project/build.properties
  ```

- Response:

  ```javascript
  {
    "type":"file",
    "name":"build.properties",
    "content":"c2J0LnZlcnNpb249MC4xMy4xMgo=",
    "encoding":"base64"
  }
  ```

Further, it also supports custom media types. By adding the `Accept` header in the request, users can choose the format of responded data. If the `Accept` header is not passed, a JSON object including the Base64 encoded content will be returned.

- Raw:

  ```
  $ curl http://localhost:8080/api/v3/repos/user1/gitbucket/contents/project/build.properties \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw"
  ```

- HTML:

  ```
  $ curl http://localhost:8080/api/v3/repos/user1/gitbucket/contents/project/build.properties \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.html"
  ```
