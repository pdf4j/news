Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 4.1](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.1)!

## Generic ssh user

Generic `git` user is available to connect git repository via SSH, so we can clone the git repository from folowing URL:

```
ssh://git@localhost:29418/root/test.git
```

instead of

```
ssh://root@localhost:29418/root/test.git
```

## Improve branch protection UI

Branch protection settings UI wasn't intuitive a little. So its UI has been updated as below:

1. When status check not found, `"Require status checks .."` checkbox is disabled
![when status check not found]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gitbucket-4.1/branch_protection_1.png)
2. When status check not selected and `"Require status checks .."` checked, submit button is disabled
![when status check not selected]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gitbucket-4.1/branch_protection_2.png)
3. When status check selected and `"Require status checks .."` checked, submit button is enabled
![selected]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gitbucket-4.1/branch_protection_3.png)

## Default value of pull request title

Default value of the pull request has been generated from commit message or branch name.

![Default value of pull request title]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gitbucket-4.1/pull-request-title.png)

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fix. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.1) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
