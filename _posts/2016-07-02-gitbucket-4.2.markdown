> **Note:** [GitBucket 4.2.1](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.2.1) is available. This is hotfix for a critical bug in migration. If you are new installation, use 4.2.0. But if you have an existing installation and it had been updated to 4.0 from 3.x, you must update to 4.2.1.

Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 4.2](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.2)!

## New UI based on AdminLTE

UI refreshing is still ongoing. [AdminLTE](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE) is graceful admin control panel theme for Bootstrap. In GitBucket 4.2, this AdminLTE is fully applied to GitBucket UI.
