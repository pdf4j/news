GitBucket sponsors [ScalaMatsuri 2016](http://scalamatsuri.org/index_en.html) the international Scala conference in Japan as "Samurai" sponsor!

In the last year's ScalaMatsuri, we could attend many sessions by professional Scala developers. For example, keynote session by Martin Odersky, About sbt by Eugene Yokota (Typesafe), About Apache Spark by Aaron Davidson (Databricks) and About Scalding, Storm and Summingbird by Yoshimasa Niwa (Twitter).

Also we talked about GitBucket at ScalaMatsuri Day1 and got an additional session in Day2 unconference.

This year, there are many [candidate sessions](http://scalamatsuri.org/en/candidates/) and voting by attendees just now! We did not propose a session about GitBucket. However we are looking forward to attend ScalaMatsuri this year again :-)
