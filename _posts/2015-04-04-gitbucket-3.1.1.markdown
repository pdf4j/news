Today, We released [GitBucket 3.1.1](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/3.1.1).

In GitBucket 3.1, included H2 causes version compatibility issue for some environments. Therefore H2 version is rolled back in this release. If you have a trouble in upgrading to GitBucket 3.1, please try this release.

This release also contains small improvement for plug-ins. `Plugin` became possible to access `ServletContext` in `initialize()` and `shutdown()`. By this change, [Gist plug-in](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-gist-plugin) became to provide the correct URL in the header.

In addition, some bug fix and improvements are contained in this release. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.1.1) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
