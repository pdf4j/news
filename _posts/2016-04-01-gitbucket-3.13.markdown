Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 3.13](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/3.13)!

## Refresh user interface for wide screen

GitBucket has been providing user interface which is similar to GitHub. But in this release, GitBucket user interface has been updated as suitable for wide screen with the sidebar.

This update is because we have to eliminate similarity from GitHub. If you want to know details of reason of this update, see [my previous blog post](https://gitbucket.github.io/gitbucket-news/gitbucket/2016/03/20/change-user-interface.html).

## Add pull_request key in list issues API for pull requests

GitHub pull request builder plugin had been ignoring the trigger like `"test this please"` because GitBucket list issues API does not contain `pull_request` key in the payload.

In this release, GitBucket adds `pull_request` to the payload of the list issues API as following:

```javascript
...
"pull_request": {
  "url": "http://localhost:8080/api/v3/repos/octocat/Hello-World/pulls/1347",
  "html_url": "http://localhost:8080/octocat/Hello-World/pull/1347"
},
...
```

## Add X-Hub-Signature security to webhooks

To provide secure webhook, GitBucket now adds `X-Hub-Signature` header to the response using [xhub4j](https://github.com/McFoggy/xhub4j) if you configure.

## Provide SHA-256 checksum

We have been providing MD5 and SHA-1 checksum for the release file. Since this release, we are providing SHA-256 checksum also.

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fix. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.13) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
