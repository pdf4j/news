We've released new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 2.8](https://github.com/gitbucke/gitbucket/releases/tag/2.8) today! This is a first release in 2015.

## New logo and icons

New logo and icons are available. Of course, favicon has been also updated.

**The Instant Git Server** is our new concept of GitBucket. We will continue to add many features to GitBucket, but we have to keep this concept in its process.

## New system setting options

2 new options to control visibility had been added to system settings.

Default visibility of new repository has been configurable at the system setting. If you enable this option, the initial state of visibility at the new repository creation page becomes private.

And an option to deny anonymous (i.e. unauthorized) access has been added also. If this option is enabled, sign-in is required to access to GitBucket.

## Comment on side-by-side diff

In GitBucket 2.7, we provided comment for changeset. However it was available only unified style. In 2.8, it's available for side-by-side view also.

## Information message on sign-in page

Displays the information message box on top of the sign-in page not only at the sidebar of dashboard.

## Fork group selector

Until GitBucket 2.7, we can fork repository by only sign-in user. In 2.8, the fork group became selectable. This selector is not displayed if you don't belong to any groups.
