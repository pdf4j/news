Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 3.2](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/3.2)!

This release contains some improvements of the repository viewer as below:

## Directory history button

GitHub's "Browse commits for this branch" button has been added at the file list view.

## Compare / pull request button

Compare button has been added at left of the branch selector.

If the current branch has been already sent as the pull request, this button is linked to that pull request.

In addition, some bug fix and improvements are contained in this release. One of them is [resolving DB connection error in development mode](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/pull/709). This fix is very helpful for GitBucket developers.

## Limit of activity log

GitBucket records all activity log in default but huge activity logs makes GitBucket is heavy. In GitBucket 3.2, we can set a limit of activity log. If number of activity logs is over this limit, old logs are deleted.

See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.2) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
