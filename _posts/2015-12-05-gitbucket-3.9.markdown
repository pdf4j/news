## Start Solidbase Development

GitBucket is using its own migration system for automatic migration. Its main target is RDBMS, and it does not support multi-tenancy so GitBucket provides another migration system for plug-ins.

We started to make a new migration system named [Solidbase](https://github.com/gitbucket/solidbase) to renew GitBucket migration system in the future.

Solidbase has following features:

- Multi-database (based on Liquibase)
- Multi-resource (not only RDBMS)
- Multi-tenancy (each modules can have independent version)

Solidbase supports multi-databse using Liquibase. We can supports any databases supported by Liquibase (e.g. H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL and more) by one abstract definition. And it does not target specific resources such as RDBMS. We can use it for any resources that need migration such as the git repository or file system. In addition, Solidbase also supports multi-tenancy so plug-ins will use it in the future.

Anyway, Solidbase is under development. We will continue to development and integrate it into GitBucket.

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fix. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.9) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
