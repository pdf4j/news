Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 3.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/3.0)!

## New Plug-in system

GitBucket 3.0 includes the new plug-in system.

We can now make plug-in as standard SBT project. Plug-ins are completely integrated to GitBucket, So we can use all capability of GitBucket in plug-in. For example, we can write a plug-in controller as Scalatra controller and also we can use Slick in plug-in.

Please note, all classes are moved to `gitbucket.core` to separate from plug-in classes explicitly.

We've also released [gitbucket-gist-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-gist-plugin) which provides Gists like code snippet repository as a practical plug-in example.

You can install this plug-in by following procedure:

1. Hit `./sbt.sh package` in the root directory of this repository.
2. Copy `target/scala-2.11/gitbucket-gist-plugin_2.11-1.0.jar` into `GITBUCKET_HOME/plugins`.
3. Restart GitBucket.

## Connection pooling

Added connection pooling by c3p0 to improve performance.

In the near future, GitBucket will move to Slick3. It supports connection pooling by HikariCP. c3p0 based connection pooling might be temporary solution.

## New branch UI

The Branch UI has been similar to GitHub it. Now it shows number of ahead and behind commits also.

## Compare between specified commit ids

The compare view now provides diff for specified commit ids at `REPOSITORY_URL/compare/from...to`, not only branch names.

In addition, some bug fix and improvements are contained in this release. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.0) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
