Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 2.2](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/2.2)!

You can write plug-in by JavaScript but plug-in system is still unstable. Therefore plug-in API will be changed in the future version.

## Move to Scala 2.11

Move to Scala 2.11 from 2.10. And it's also upgrade frameworks. We are now using Scalatra 2.3 and Slick 2.1. Especially, moving to Slick 2.1 is a first step of multiple database driver support.

## tar.gz export for repository contents

You can export repository contents as tar.gz not only zip.
