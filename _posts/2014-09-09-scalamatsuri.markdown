[ScalaMatsuri](http://scalamatsuri.org/en/) the interational conference for Scala developers in Japan was held at last weekend. I gave a speech about GitBucket in the first day of this conference. In my talk, described technologies and tools which support GitBucket and its development.

Second day was [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). I got a session for casual talk about GitBucket named 'GitBucket Kaigi'. In this session, I talked about motivation and history of GitBucket, new Scala base plugin system, performance and scaling with some GitBucket users.

There were many wonderful sessions in this conference. For example, 'Keynote Address - The Evolution of Scala' by Martin Odersky, 'Building a Unified "Big Data" Pipeline in Apache Spark' by Aaron Davidson and some case studies in production use of Scala by Hatena and Gree.

On the whole, ScalaMatsuri was very meaningful for all participants, of course for me too. I hope that it will be held again next year.

Great thanks for all staffs, speakers, sponsors and all participants. See you again next year!
