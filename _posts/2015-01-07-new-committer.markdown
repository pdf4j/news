[Shintaro Murakami](https://github.com/mrkm4ntr) he is a contributor of [comment on changeset](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/pull/564) that is an excellent new feature in GitBucket 2.7 joined GitBucket team!

This feature has been wished from many users for a long time. We couldn't start to implement this feature up to now because we didn't have enough resource to do it. Therefore his work was really great.

Also, he is continuing great contribution in 2.8 currently. I believe he will give a lot of things to GitBucket and all GitBucket users.

Check 2.8, the next release of GitBucket which will come at the end of this month!
