GitBucket reached 5000 stars on GitHub, and has over 600 forks and over 80 contributors.

However we have a lot of things we would like to do, so we need more support from users, contributors and also plugin developers.

Therefore we published [a following page](https://gitbucket.github.io/gitbucket-news/recruit/) today:

[![GitBucket needs your help!]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gitbucket-needs-your-help/gitbucket_recruit.png)](https://gitbucket.github.io/gitbucket-news/recruit/)

GitBucket is open source. We are waiting for your pull request!
