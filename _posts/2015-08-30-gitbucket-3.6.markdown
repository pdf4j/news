Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 3.6](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/3.6)!

## User interface improvements

Some parts of GitBucket user interface had not been catched up to GitHub. In GitBucket 3.6, we have updated GitBucket design to more flat and sharp.

Also we have made large user interface update to some features such as the commit history and the pull request. Especially, pull request became more easy to use.

Added the installed plugin list to the administration console. We can confirm installed plugins and these description and version using it.
