Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 3.12](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/3.12)!

## New GitHub UI

GitBucket now supports current GitHub UI. Repository menu moved to the top from right-side. It provides more width for repository contents.

## Improved mobile view

Since GitBucket 3.10, Mobile view has been broken because we moved to Bootstrap 3. We improved mobile view in this version with new GitHub UI mentioned above.

## Improve printing style

Printing CSS is improved a little. This would help you when you print Wiki pages.

## Individual URL for pull request tabs

Each tab of the pull request (i.e. "Conversation", "Commits" and "Files Changed") has the individual URL. You can link to specific tab using this link.

## SSH host configuration is separated from HTTP base URL

GitBucket had generated SSH URL using the hostname in HTTP base URL up to now. So it had been impossible to give different hostname from HTTP URL. In GitBucket 3.12, you can specify the independent hostname for SSH URL.

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fix. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.12) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
