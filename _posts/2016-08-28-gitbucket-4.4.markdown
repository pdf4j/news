Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 4.4](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.4)!

## Import a SQL dump file to the database

Importing a SQL dump file to the database is available in the administration console.

**Note:** XML export and import are abolished along with this.

## `go get` support in private repositories

`go get` support has been available in public repositories until 4.3. Since 4.4, it's also available in private repositories. GitBucket generates HTML for private repositories as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="go-import" content="localhost:8080/root/hogege git http://localhost:8080/git/root/hogege.git" />
  </head>
</html>
```

## Sort milestones by due date

The list of milestones has been sorted by due date.

## apache-sshd has been updated to 1.2.0

[apache-sshd](https://mina.apache.org/sshd-project/) has been updated to 1.2.0.

DSA (ssh-dss) is not recommended because of the vulnerability, however GitBucket has supported only DSA until 4.3. By this update, you can use RSA to connect git repository on the GitBucket via SSH.

In addition, this release contains some improvements and bug fix. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.4) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
