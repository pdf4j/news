Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 3.5](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/3.5) with [Gist plug-in](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-gist-plugin) update!

## Octicons

[Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/) is an open-source web font contains GitHub like icons provided by GitHub. GitBucket and Gist plug-in now use Octicons instead of bitmap icons. It makes beautiful appearance even if for large display.

Global header has been enhanced. Now it's further similar to GitHub.

## Default compare / pull request target

In the previous version of GitBucket, the default target of comparing or pull request from the branch list was the default branch of the current repository.

However since GitBucket 3.5, it has been changed to the default branch of the parent repository as same as GitHub.
