At the end of 2014, we've released new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 2.7](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/2.7)!

This is a final release in this year. We could continue monthly release this year. Thanks for GitBucket team, all contributors and users.

In this release, comment for commit and diff is available. We can use this feature for code review.

This big feature is [contributed by Shintaro Murakami](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/pull/564). Great Thanks!

In addition, some bug fix, improvements and security fix are contained in this release. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=milestone%3A2.7+is%3Aclosed) to know details. Also [a security issue in markdown processing](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues/577) had been fixed in this release. Therefore we highly recommend upgrading your GitBucket to 2.7.

Enjoy GitBucket!
