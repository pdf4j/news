Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 3.8](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/3.8)!

## GitBucket moved to GitHub organization

We complete to move all of GitBucket repositories to [the gitbucket organization](https://github.com/gitbucket) to glow up as open-source community. Now, we have following repositories:

- [gitbucket](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket)
- [gitbucket-news](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-news)
- [gitbucket-gist-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-gist-plugin)

Also, we will provide official plug-ins or libraries used in GitBucket at this organization.
